## 🔬 Deep Learning & Neural Network Lab – Experiments

1. Introduction to Keras and TensorFlow (Optional: PyTorch). Configure and use Google Colab and Kaggle GPU.

2. Develop a multi-class classifier using Deep Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Keras/TensorFlow/PyTorch for MNIST hand recognition dataset and CIFAR-10.

3. Develop a CNN-based classification model for Cat vs Dog dataset.  
   - Analyze model accuracy and generate classification report  
   - Develop GUI and test user-given inputs  
   - Analyze results with and without regularization/dropout

4. Develop a Face Recognition System using CNN.  
   - Create a dataset of minimum 50 students  
   - Validate model accuracy  
   - Apply dimensionality reduction and analyze accuracy changes

5. Write a program to demonstrate the change in accuracy, loss, and convergence time using different optimizers such as SGD, Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Nadam.

6. Apply Transfer Learning using pre-trained models (VGG16 / ResNet50 / MobileNet) on a given dataset and analyze the results.

7. Develop a Sequential Model using RNN / LSTM / GRU for a suitable application.

8. Develop an Autoencoder to encode and decode images and analyze the results.

9. Case Study on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
